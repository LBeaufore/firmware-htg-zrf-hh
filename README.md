# HTG-ZRF-HH Base Firmware

This is the base firmware for messing with the HTG-ZRF-HH.

The goal here is to integrate everything that's needed to take
8 channels worth of ADC data and access it from the PS side
using Pynq, and also allow outputting DAC waveforms on demand.

Not complete yet, still working on it.
